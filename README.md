# angStories - JSON and Angular based photo & poetry galleries

This project aims to feel a void when it comes to photo galleries templates. I never find myself happy with
what I find when looking for photo galleries because they somehow always forget to provide tools for the text that could
come with the images.

Each gallery is described by a json file.

Then each gallery is displayed according to the json file.


## Getting Started

You can clone this github repository.

Then npm install will install the required libraries.

npm start will start the app.
